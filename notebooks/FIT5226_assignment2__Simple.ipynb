Self.item_revisit_penalty gives a penalty for revisiting the item position. We assign a large goal reward of `self.goal_state_reward` for reaching the goal state with the item, and we apply a penalty of `self.goal_no_item_penalty` if the agent reaches the goal without the item. The goal state is only valid when the item has been collected; reaching the goal before collecting the item results in a large penalty to discourage this. Apart from these cases, a time penalty of `self.time_penalty` is consistently applied to encourage efficiency in completing the task.\n"

This calculation was done for all possible agent, item and goal locations within the environment.
