We assign a large goal reward of `self.goal_state_reward` for reaching the goal state with the item, and we apply a penalty of `self.goal_no_item_penalty` if the agent reaches the goal without the item. The goal state is only valid when the item has been collected; reaching the goal before collecting the item results in a large penalty to discourage this. Apart from these cases, a time penalty of `self.time_penalty` is consistently applied to encourage efficiency in completing the task.\n"

After training, we evaluated the agent's performance by calculating the ratio of the shortest possible distance (using Manhattan distance) to the actual number of steps taken by the agent from the start position, through the item, and finally reaching the goal (shortest distance / actual distance taken by the agent). This calculation was done for all possible agent, item and goal locations within the environment. A ratio of 1 indicates that the actual path matches the shortest path, while a ratio less than 1 suggests a longer path was taken. By averaging these ratios across all possible scenarios, we can obtain the metric.\n",
